# AuctionBot
Simulation of various Auction Theory methods using reinforcement learning. 

# Project 
This is my latest passion project I am doing. I am attempting to simulate various auction theory methods established in age-old economics 
and create a type of simulator bot which engages with a human user. Throughout this project, I have a few goals which include finding an
applied method to not just the auction house space but also various kinds of securities trading. 

As always, I look for collaborators, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for more detail.
